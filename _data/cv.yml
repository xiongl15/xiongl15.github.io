  - My PhD research focuses on developing artificial intelligence tool for analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data to uncover gene regulation in cell heterogeneity. In my PhD dissertation, “Artificial intelligence method for single-cell ATAC-seq data via feature extraction”, I studied analysis methods for uncovering the regulatory variations across various cell types observed from high-dimensional and sparse single-cell ATAC-seq data. 
  - I am also passionate about applying network analysis methods. Previously, I did some research in structural-protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to find out structural modules enriching cancer mutations and drug targets.

    - 'Determine the structure of human GLUT3 in complex with D-glucose at 1.5 Å resolution in an outward-occluded conformation and provided insights into the alternating access cycle for GLUTS. I was responsible for comparison of glucose uptake efficiency among different mutated proteins. I cloned over 200 plasmids of different point mutations, constructed the bacmids and expressed in insect cells, purified the proteins and assayed their glucose transporting efficiency.'
